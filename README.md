## 🛠️ How to Use

To get started with AskMate, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL**: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed (version 12 or higher is recommended).
2. **Import Database Dump**: Use the provided PostgreSQL dump to set up the database.
   - The dump file is located in the `sample_data` folder.
3. **Configure Database Credentials**:
   - Add your PostgreSQL password to the `user.txt` file.
   - Alternatively, for enhanced security, you can use an environmental variable to hide your credentials. (Note: This requires modifying `data_manager.py`.)
